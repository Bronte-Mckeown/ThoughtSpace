# ThoughtSpace

Welcome to ThoughtSpace. 

ThoughtSpace is a Python-based toolbox for analysing experience sampling data via Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to identify common "patterns of thought".

## A Beginners Guide

This readme is a Beginners guide to using ThoughtSpace that assumes little-to-no prior knowledge of coding and GitHub. 

It does assume you already have a GitHub account set up. So, if you don't, create one first!

The guide will take you through installation and your first analysis, with examples:

- [Installing Github Desktop](https://github.com/Bronte-Mckeown/ThoughtSpace/blob/Rhom/Installing_GitHub_Desktop.md)
- [Setting Up Visual-Studio Code](https://github.com/Bronte-Mckeown/ThoughtSpace/blob/Rhom/Installing_VS_Code.md)
- [Setting Up Python in VSCode](https://github.com/Bronte-Mckeown/ThoughtSpace/blob/Rhom/Setting_Up_Python.md)

## Setting Up and Running ThoughtSpace

If you have the necessary interpreter and programming steps set up, you can get into preparing and running ThoughtSpace.

If you're new to GitHub, here's a guide to forking and cloning the ThoughtSpace repository:

- [Fork and Clone ThoughtSpace](https://github.com/Bronte-Mckeown/ThoughtSpace/blob/Rhom/Fork_and_Clone_ThoughtSpace.md)

Once you've set up a local (and forked) ThoughtSpace repository on your computer, you can set up a virtual environment for using ThoughtSpace:

- [Setting Up ThoughtSpace](https://github.com/Bronte-Mckeown/ThoughtSpace/blob/Rhom/Set_Up_ThoughtSpace.md)
    - [Updating ThoughtSpace](https://github.com/Bronte-Mckeown/ThoughtSpace/blob/Rhom/updating_thoughtspace.md)
