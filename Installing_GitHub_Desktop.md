### Installing GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a an application provided by GitHub. 

It allows users to interact with Git repositories visually (rather than from the oh-so-scary command line) and provides an easier way for users, especially beginners, to manage their version-controlled projects.

I recommend using GitHub desktop for all git-related steps described below.

So... if you haven't already install GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/) and sign into your account.
