### Installing Visual Studio Code

We are going to start with making sure you have visual studio code (VS Code) installed. If you already have it installed, skip to the next section.

#### What is VS code?

*What it is:* Visual Studio Code is like a digital workspace on your computer. It's a text editor, but it's much more than that. It's a powerful tool that helps you write, edit, and debug code easily in various programming languages, including Python and R.

*Imagine It Like:* Think of Visual Studio Code as a blank notebook where you write down your thoughts and ideas. In this case, your "thoughts" are the code you write for different programming languages.

If you have never used it before, here are the steps to install, assuming you have a windows machine (the steps may vary slightly for mac users):

**1. Download Visual Studio Code:**

- Open your web browser and go to the official Visual Studio Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/.
- Click on the "Download for Windows" button. This will download the installer file to your computer.

**2. Run the Installer:**

- Once the download is complete, locate the installer file (it's usually named something like VSCodeSetup-x64-<version>.exe) and double-click on it to run the installer.

**3. License agreement:**

- The installer will launch a setup wizard and present the license agreement. Click "I Agree" and then "Next" to proceed.

**4. Select Destination Location:**

- Choose the destination location where you want to install Visual Studio Code. 
- On Windows, it's common to install software applications in the "Program Files" directory (or "Program Files (x86)" on 64-bit systems). 
    - This is usually the default installation location suggested by the VS Code installer.
    - Installing in the Program Files directory helps keep your system organized and ensures that the software is accessible to all users on the computer.
- The default location is usually fine for most users. Click "Next" to continue.

**5. Select Start Menu Folder:**

- Choose the folder where you want shortcuts for Visual Studio Code to appear in the Start menu. Click "Next."

**6. Select Additional Tasks:**

- Optionally, you can choose to create desktop and Quick Launch icons, and associate file types with Visual Studio Code. 
- Keep the default options and additionally choose the options according to your preference and click "Next."

**7. Install:**

- Click the "Install" button to begin the installation process. The installer will copy the necessary files to your computer.

**8. Completion:**

- Once the installation is complete, click "Finish" to exit the installer. You can optionally chose to launch visual studio code at this point too.

**9. Launch Visual Studio Code:**

- After installation, you can launch Visual Studio Code by finding it in the Start menu or by double-clicking the desktop icon if you created one during the installation process.
